PerPerson
=========

This was a school assignment for the subject "Data visualization" at Fontys ICT & Media Design. The assignment was to visualize an existing data-set.

##Concept
The concept I came up with is called "Per Person". I've combined multiple data-sets in one visualization showing little facts like for example water usage and motorized vehicles per person. What makes it interesting is the ability to compare countries. By the data you get you can see for example the differences in welfare, or how big a country is.

##Realization
It was built using PHP and JavaScript, and of course HTML & CSS. As part of the assignment we had to build a PHP dashboard where you could manage the data-sets, the data is fed into the visualization by a self-	build API. You can add and update any of the data.
